# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Transfer-Learning

Pneumonia is an infectious and fatal respiratory disease caused by bacteria, fungi, or a virus that infects human lung air sacs with a load full of fluid or pus.

Chest x-rays are the common method used to diagnose pneumonia and it takes a medical expert to assess the result of the x-ray. The troublesome method of detecting pneumonia leads to loss of life due to improper diagnosis and treatment.

With the emerging computing power, the development of an automatic pneumonia detection and disease treatment system is now possible, especially if the patient is in a remote area and medical services are limited.

## Dataset

The dataset I’m using here is stored as .jpg files in 2 different folders one is named with Normal which consists of normal chest x-ray Images and other is named with Pneumonia which consists of pneumonia images.
